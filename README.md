# DS4A_Women_Summit

Project Goal:
In this project, we are trying to see if delay/cancellation patterns impact stock / financial performance at all. 

#### Data:
Airline Travel -- includes datasets for commercial airline traffic, passenger fares, major US events, weather, and airline stock prices
 
 * airlines.csv: Mapping of airline codes to names.
 * airports.csv: Important details (name, state, identifier, latitude, longitude, etc.) on various US airports.
 * events_US.csv: Public events from around the US throughout 2017.
 * fares.csv: Airline fare distributions for each quarter-route-airline combination in 2017 with a bucket size of $10.
 * flight_traffic.csv: Information about delays for US domestic flights in 2017.
